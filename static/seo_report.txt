The Bad:
Description is missing, too short, or not relevant! Add a proper Meta Description
Multiple H1 tags found: 14

Recommendations:
Include a meta description that accurately describes the page content and includes relevant keywords.
Use only one H1 tag per page to ensure clear content hierarchy.
